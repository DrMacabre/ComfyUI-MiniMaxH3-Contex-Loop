"""Let keyframes and refs coexist.

`MiniMaxH3.extra_conds` in comfy/model_base.py fills the payload from two
independent `if` blocks. The keyframe block sets `cond_video_latents`, then
the refs block **overwrites** it:

    if keyframes is not None:
        payload["cond_video_latents"] = [kf["latent"] for kf in keyframes]
    if refs is not None:
        payload["cond_video_latents"] = [r["latent"] for r in refs if "latent" in r]
        payload["cond_audio_latents"] = [r["audio_latent"] for r in refs ...]

So attaching an audio-only ref alongside keyframes wipes the keyframe video
content: an audio-only block has no "latent" key, the list comes back empty,
and the cond rows the layout built have nothing to fill them.

The layout itself handles the combination fine. Keyframe cond rows are
emitted first, ref rows second, target rows last, which is exactly the order
the forward pass expects when it writes rows into the never-denoised slots.
Only this payload assignment is in the way.

This wrapper re-runs the same logic and concatenates instead, keeping
keyframe latents first to match the row order. It is deliberately opt-in:
the payload changes only when a keyframe or ref carries one of Motion
Context's private markers. An ordinary H3 graph combining stock keyframes
and refs therefore keeps stock ComfyUI behavior even after this wrapper has
been installed by an opted-in graph.
